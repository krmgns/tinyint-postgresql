### INSTALL
Download and unzip content, then use `make` tool (seems also server restart needed in some cases). Here is all-in-one command;

```sh
cd /tmp && \
apt install unzip -y && \
apt install postgresql-server-dev-13 -y && \ # or any version
wget https://github.com/okerem/tinyint-postgresql/archive/master.zip && \
unzip master.zip && cd tinyint-postgresql-master && \
make && make install && service postgresql restart
```

### NOTICE
Fixed some bugs those addressed on issue pages and added `int1` alias as domain. But after some tests the results were very surprising; because `tinyint` field index (BTree) size became very huge (about %150-200 more) comparing to `smallint` and `enum` fields. So, for this issue, field types can be converted to `smallint` and also GIN method can be used instead. But, seems whatever we do, both these methods ain't able to get speed of real integers.

### ORIGINAL README

```
tinyint-postgresql

This is an extension that impelements tinyint (1 byte integer) as a data type
of PostgreSQL. Traditionally, PostgreSQL core has a policy not to have 1 byte
integer in it. With this module, you can define 1 byte integer column on your
tables, which will help query performances and portabilities from other RDBMS.
